# Petrolink DataQuality Algorithm (Open-Sourced Python Implementation)
This "DATAQUALITY_ALGORITHM" repository is the home of Petrolink's "open sourced" python DataQuality algorithm.

In this repository there are 2 main directories, these are "input" and "src". The "input" directory is self explanitory as that is where users are to put all ".csv" input data. The "src" directory is where users will find the directories that contain the source code, unittesting suites, as well as configurations for the executable "Runner" and the importable "Library".
