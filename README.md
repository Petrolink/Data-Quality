# Petrolink DataQuality Algorithm (Open-Sourced Python Implementation)
This "DataQuality_Algorithm" repository is the home of Petrolink's "open sourced" python DataQuality algorithm.

In this repository there are 2 main directories, these are "input" and "src". The "input" directory is self explanitory as that is where users are to put the static ".csv" data they would like to run a DataQuality analysis on. The "src" directory is where users will find the directories that contain the source code, unittesting suites, configurations, and documentation for the executable "Runner" and the importable "Library".

Aside from the 2 main directories are the output .csv files. These files are the output produced by the executable runner. These outputs include aggregation output for hourly/daily data as well as overall output for the entire data set.
